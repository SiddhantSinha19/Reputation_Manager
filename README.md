With the internet being a massive weapon of both construction and destruction, this Reputation Management is designed to monitor users’ online reviews of products and services. It helps spread positive customer experiences through review platforms and help tackle the negative reviews and comments.

Reputation Manager uses the relevant information to increase a company’s sales by giving it insights on how consumers view the business. In the event, the software captures a negative review, the company can contact that person and assist him/her in getting a richer experience, which could alter what he/she thinks of the organization. In essence, the software helps not only customers but companies as well, by helping them improve.

Please note: If you download the entire code and try to run as it is, it might not work because it uses my credential to get data via youtubeAPI, and my team-mate's credential to get data from twitter.

So please use this code as a reference and use your own credentials.
